# Blog-restart

My previous Blog page was BlogM. I lost my notes regarding it, and it became "easier" to restart rather than clone down, re-make the notes, and continue.


# Notes for continuation
  * posts#show needs to check author/permissions before showing. Requires EQ helper (dont have installed atm)

  * Tags do not have edit or ability to add to other posts (though the power is there)

  * the layout could use a LOT of work. Using semantic or bootstrap to clean it up would help A LOT!!!!!

  * Talk to C. about doing a real-time KoC [or lost realm?] game for my final project rather than this stupid blogger crap :).
    >Required:
      >>Complex routing
      >>User accounts and authentication
      >>'ticks' or day-resets
      >>various stats and computed-properties
      >>Item counts
    >Could allow for:
      >>'World Bosses'?
      >>Specialized profile stuff (uploadable pics?)
